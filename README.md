# 📊 AtliQ Grands Hospitality Analytics Dashboard

## 🧩 Project Overview

AtliQ Grands is a five-star hotel chain operating across India. Recently, they’ve experienced a drop in market share and revenue in both their **luxury** and **business** categories due to ineffective strategic decisions. The company decided to adopt **Business and Data Intelligence** as a strategic initiative to regain control.

As a Data Analyst, I was tasked with:
- Creating metrics as per business definitions.
- Designing a Power BI dashboard based on stakeholder mockups.
- Deriving actionable insights beyond the original scope.
